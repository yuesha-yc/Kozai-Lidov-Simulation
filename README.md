## Abstract

Step-by-step simulation of three-body celestial body motion using the basic laws of gravitation and Newtonian mechanics is an alternative to analytical solutions, and it is especially useful when studying Kozai–Lidov mechanism, a dynamical phenomenon affecting the orbit of a binary system perturbed by a distant third body under certain conditions, causing the orbit's argument of pericenter to oscillate about a constant value, which in turn leads to a periodic exchange between its eccentricity and inclination. This work discussed the original Hamiltonian analysis of Kozai-Lidov mechanism and used computer program to simulate two constructed, arbitrary models of three-body systems, obtaining the orbital inclination, eccentricity, mutual inclination, and Kozai-Lidov constant’s periodic change. Analyzing the simulated results with the theory, this work verified Kozai-Lidov Mehanism’s successful application on two typical three-body gravitational interaction cases. 

Key words: Kozai-Lidov Mechanism, Computer Simulation, Three-Body System, Hamilton Mechanism, Planetary Eccentricity, Planetary Inclination.
