# Kozai-Lidov-Simulation
Kozai-Lidov Simulation of special cases of Three-Body Problem using Python and Matplotlib. 

This simulation includes one star and two planets. Since the TBP does not have an analytical solution, computer simulation is used to simulate the change of inclination and eccentricity of the orbits.
